***2H Programming Arithmetic Challenge - Factor-3-up***

***Summary***
For any positive integer n, let d(n) be the number of positive integer divisors of n. For example, d(12) = 6 because 12 has 6 factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.  
Find numbers that have exactly 3 or 6 factors.  

***Task*** 
Write a computer programme to calculate and output all positive integers n not exceeding 100,000 such that n has exactly 3 or 6 factors. (n â‰¤ 100,000; d(n) = 3 or 6).  

Expected Output:
4 
9 
12 
18 
... 

Limitations:
Character count < 10,000 
Time used < 10 min 
Memory used < 256 MB 

***GRADING***
These will add up to your score:
(number of correct numbers outputted)^2 / (total number of correct numbers based on the model answer) / (total number of numbers outputted)* 100, rounded down to the nearest integer
Output takes less than 30 seconds >> 30 -(time taken by your program to finish running in seconds) bonus points, rounded off to the nearest integer

Restrictions:
Output is not in sorted order >> 15 points will be deducted.
