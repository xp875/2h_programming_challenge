***Arithmetic Challenge: Factor-3-up***

***Summary***
For any positive integer n, let d(n) be the number of positive integer divisors of n. For example, d(12) = 6 because 12 has 6 factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.  
Find numbers that have exactly 3 or 6 factors.  

 

TASK 
Write a computer programme to calculate and output all positive integers n not exceeding 100,000 such that n has exactly 3 or 6 factors. (n â‰¤ 100,000; d(n) = 3 or 6).  

Your program should output all the numbers to the standard output in ascending order, each on a new line. The first few numbers are shown below in the expected format:  

4 
9 
12 
18 
... 

Code character count limit: 10,000 
Running time limit: 10 min 
Memory limit: 256 MB 
Warning: Do not plagiarise code from others or the internet 

 

***GRADING***
These will add up to your score:
(number of correct numbers outputted)^2 / (total number of correct numbers based on the model answer) / (total number of numbers outputted)* 100, rounded down to the nearest integer
(time taken by your program to finish running in seconds) bonus points, rounded off to the nearest integer

Additional Restrictions:
If the output is not in sorted order, 15 points will be deducted.
